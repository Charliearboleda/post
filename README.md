## Approach
#### Picking a Project Idea
- Our main basis for selecting a project was to create a category of app that none of us had experience building. This was really difficult because we were at the end of the course and we had created a variety of different types of apps. We went with a social media app because none of us had implemented friend/follower functionality into any of our projects before.

#### Splitting the Work
- We spent the first day pair-programming both our front- and back-end setup, then eventually split up into separate tasks.
- Charlie implemented authentication with Firebase, react-router, and some Context (thank you, [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwu15ldZ7k))
- Ahmed set up the basic components and implemented the file upload functionality.
- Josh focused on keeping the formatting of code consistent throughout the codebase and organized the file structure.

#### Data Structure
- We set up our data to be a series of one-to-many relationships (users -> posts -> comments), which was very simple to conceptualize. Our challenge was to implement custom queries via our Django backend, which we had never done before.

## User Stories
#### Core
- As a user, I should be able to log into my own account.
- As a user, I should be able to see different 'pages' depending on what I click on.
- As a user, I should be able to create a post so I can show off my perfect life.
- As a user, I should be able to edit or delete a post.
- As a user, I should be able to upload images from my device.
- As a user, I should be able to search for other users.
- As a user, I should be able to follow and be followed by other users.
- As a user, I should be able to post comments under posts.
- ~~As a user, I should be able to go to a single post view to see all post details and comments.~~

#### Stretch
- As a user, I should be able to change my account settings.
- As a user, I should be able to set my sharing settings (public, friends, only self)
- As a user, there should be validation using the Luhn algorithm when I enter my credit card info for no reason.
